## Decisions Made During Build

### 01 — CSS & Tailwind Setup
- Upgraded from Tailwind v3 to **Tailwind v4** (v4.3.1) using `@tailwindcss/vite` Vite plugin
- Design tokens defined via `@theme {}` in `resources/css/app.css` — no `tailwind.config.js` used for colors
- PostCSS config emptied (Tailwind v4 Vite plugin handles CSS processing; Lightning CSS includes autoprefixer)
- `@tailwindcss/forms` v0.5.x is v3-only; form inputs styled manually with design tokens
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts), loaded via `<link>` in `layouts/central.blade.php`

### 01 — Architecture Decisions
- `resources/views/layouts/central.blade.php` uses `<x-component>` slot pattern (not `@extends`)
- `resources/views/central/` subfolder created for all central app views
- `app/Http/Controllers/Central/SchoolRegistrationController.php` created; provisioning logic stubbed (wired in Phase 1.3)
- `routes/web.php` now holds all central routes; Breeze auth routes still included via `require __DIR__.'/auth.php'`
- Sitemap generated via a Blade view (`central/sitemap.blade.php`) returned as `application/xml`
- Robots.txt served via inline route closure

### 01 — UI Patterns Established
- Dashboard preview on landing page is an HTML/CSS mockup (no real screenshot yet — will be replaced after Phase 2 dashboard is built)
- Subdomain live preview uses Alpine.js `x-data` computed property; strips invalid chars client-side (server still validates)
- FAQ uses Alpine.js accordion with Schema.org `FAQPage` markup for featured snippets
- Landing hero uses CSS gradient text (`-webkit-background-clip: text`) — only on the main H1 gradient span
- Pricing table uses a `grid grid-cols-4` layout with alternating row backgrounds (`bg-surface-secondary` on odd rows)

---

### 02 — Multi-Tenancy Setup
- stancl/tenancy v3 configured with **subdomain-based** tenant identification (`InitializeTenancyBySubdomain`)
- Custom `App\Models\Central\Tenant` and `App\Models\Central\Domain` models extend stancl base models
- `central` DB connection added to `config/database.php`; `DB_CONNECTION=central` in `.env`
- `config/tenancy.php`: `central_connection` hardcoded to `'central'`; central_domains includes `schoolflow.test`, `www.schoolflow.test`, `schoolflow.com`, `www.schoolflow.com`
- Central migrations ran on `schoolflow` DB (XAMPP MySQL): users, tenants, domains, personal_access_tokens, etc.
- Tenant database created automatically on `Tenant::create()` via `TenantCreated` event → `CreateDatabase + MigrateDatabase` pipeline
- `database/migrations/tenant/` directory created for future tenant-scoped migrations
- Verified: `demo` tenant + `demo.schoolflow.test` domain created via tinker; `tenantdemo` DB auto-provisioned
- `APP_NAME=SchoolFlow`, `APP_URL=http://schoolflow.test` set in `.env`

---

### 03 — Tenant Provisioning

- `App\Services\TenantProvisioningService` created — `provision()` returns `['success', 'data', 'error']` shape per code-standards
- `Tenant::create()` fires `TenantCreated` → `CreateDatabase + MigrateDatabase` synchronously (via `TenancyServiceProvider` pipeline)
- On failure, `$tenant->delete()` fires `TenantDeleted` → `DeleteDatabase` for rollback
- `buildTenantDomain()` derives the base host from `APP_URL` — works for both `schoolflow.test` (dev) and `schoolflow.com` (prod)
- `App\Models\Tenant\User` created at `app/Models/Tenant/User.php` — extends `Authenticatable`, uses `HasUuids`, no explicit `$connection` (stancl switches default connection inside `$tenant->run()`)
- `database/migrations/tenant/2026_06_13_000001_create_tenant_users_table.php` — only migration needed now; full schema in Phase 05
- **Existing demo tenant does not have the users table** — run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply to existing tenants
- `StoreSchoolRegistrationRequest` created — validation moved out of controller per code-standards
- `SchoolRegistrationController` updated: `final class`, constructor injection, `store()` delegates to service
- Subdomain collision check is in the service (domain uniqueness on `domains` table) — returns error shown on the `subdomain` field
- Success redirect goes to `{subdomain}.{APP_HOST}/login` — flash message won't survive cross-domain (session-scoped); login page wired in Phase 04

---

### 04 — Auth & Roles

- `config/auth.php` users provider switched to `App\Models\Tenant\User` — stancl's DB switch makes this work naturally per tenant
- `require __DIR__.'/auth.php'` removed from `routes/web.php` — central Breeze auth routes were unused; Super Admin auth added in Phase 7
- Tenant auth routes in `routes/tenant.php`: `GET /login`, `POST /login`, `POST /logout`, `GET /dashboard` — all named `tenant.*`
- `App\Http\Controllers\Tenant\Auth\AuthenticatedSessionController` — reuses Breeze `LoginRequest` (calls `Auth::attempt()` on the tenant-switched connection)
- Redirect after login: `route('tenant.dashboard')` via `redirect()->intended()`
- `spatie/laravel-permission` config published to `config/permission.php` — `teams: false`, cache 24h
- `database/migrations/tenant/2026_06_13_000002_create_permission_tables.php` — custom migration with `string` type for `model_id` columns (not `unsignedBigInteger`) to match UUID primary keys on `users`
- `App\Models\Tenant\User` — `HasRoles` trait added
- `TenantProvisioningService` — seeds 5 fixed roles (`school_admin`, `teacher`, `accountant`, `student`, `parent`) and assigns `school_admin` to the School Admin user inside `$tenant->run()`
- `EnsureUserHasRole` middleware registered as `has_role`; spatie's built-in `role`, `permission`, `role_or_permission` also registered in `Kernel.php`
- Tenant layout: `resources/views/layouts/tenant.blade.php` (sidebar + topbar skeleton — refined in Phase 06)
- Tenant guest layout: `resources/views/layouts/tenant-guest.blade.php` (login page wrapper)
- Sidebar nav: `resources/views/components/sidebar-nav.blade.php` — role-gated nav items; unbuilt routes render as disabled spans
- Dashboard placeholder: `resources/views/tenant/dashboard.blade.php` — replaced in Phase 06

---

### 05 — Central + Tenant Database Schema

**Tenant migrations** (`database/migrations/tenant/`):
- `000001` users — already created in Phase 03
- `000002` permission tables (spatie roles/permissions/pivots)
- `000003` school_profile (logo, address, contact, short description)
- `000004` academic_years (name, start/end dates, is_current flag)
- `000005` school_classes (name, order)
- `000006` sections (name, class_id FK)
- `000007` subjects (name, code)
- `000008` students (admission_no unique, class/section FK, guardian info, status)
- `000009` staff (user_id FK, role_title, status)
- `000010` attendances (student_id + date unique, status, marked_by FK)
- `000011` timetables (class+section+day+period unique, teacher FK, times)
- `000012` exams (name, term, academic_year_id, status)
- `000013` exam_results (exam+student+subject unique, marks, grade)
- `000014` fee_structures (class+term+item+year, amount, due_date)
- `000015` fee_payments (student+fee_structure FK, amount, status, paystack_ref, paid_at)
- `000016` announcements (title, body, posted_by FK, is_public flag)

**Central migration** (`database/migrations/`):
- `subscription_plans` — tenant_id FK, plan_name, status, renews_at

**Action required:** Run `php artisan migrate` (central) then `php artisan tenants:migrate` (all tenant DBs) to apply everything.

---

### 06 — Tenant Dashboard — Full UI

- Dashboard route `GET /dashboard` is a single route (`DashboardController::index`) — no role branching in routing; widget visibility is controlled by permission checks in the view (`@if($can['settings'])`, etc.)
- Four permission tiers render different dashboard layouts: school_admin (settings.manage) → full view with setup checklist + 4 stat cards + 3 charts; teacher (attendance.view + exams.view) → 2 stat cards + attendance chart; accountant (fees.view) → 2 fee cards + fee line chart; student/parent → simplified summary + announcements list
- Charts use **Chart.js 4.4.0 via CDN** (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`) loaded synchronously in `@stack('head')` — Alpine.js `x-init` initializes charts after mount
- `routes/tenant.php` fully restructured with `->name('tenant.')` prefix on the domain group + permission middleware on each protected group — resource routes (`students`, `staff`, `exams`) automatically get `tenant.students.index` etc. names
- Sidebar switched from role-array check (`hasRole([...])`) to `$user->can($permission)` — `null` permission = visible to all authenticated users (Dashboard, Announcements)
- `TenantProvisioningService` now seeds all 25 permissions + 5 roles with default permission sets inside `$tenant->run()` — called via the new private `seedPermissions()` method
- Stub controllers created for all 10 non-dashboard tenant routes (Student, Staff, Attendance, Timetable, Exam, Fee, Announcement, Report, RolesPermissions, CustomDomain) — each returns `tenant.coming-soon` view; PublicPageController stub returns `tenant.public-page`
- **Action required for existing tenants:** existing tenant DBs (e.g. `tenantdemo`) do not have permissions seeded. Run `php artisan tinker` and call `TenantProvisioningService::seedPermissions()` inside `$tenant->run()`, or delete and re-provision the demo tenant.

---

### 07 — Academic Year, Classes, Sections, Subjects

**Models** created in `app/Models/Tenant/`: `AcademicYear`, `SchoolClass` (table: `school_classes`), `Section`, `Subject`.

**Controllers** created in `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/`:
- `AcademicYearController` — CRUD + `setCurrent()` (DB transaction: clears all is_current, sets one)
- `SchoolClassController` — CRUD; auto-increments `order` on create if not provided
- `SectionController` — `store()` nested under class route, `destroy()` flat; redirects back with `?class_open={id}` to re-open the Sections modal
- `SubjectController` — CRUD

**Form Requests** in `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/`: `StoreAcademicYearRequest`, `UpdateAcademicYearRequest`, `StoreSchoolClassRequest`, `UpdateSchoolClassRequest`, `StoreSectionRequest`, `StoreSubjectRequest`, `UpdateSubjectRequest`.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): All settings routes live under the `permission:settings.manage` middleware group. New routes added: `/settings` (redirect), `/settings/academic-year` (CRUD), `/settings/classes` (CRUD), `/settings/classes/{schoolClass}/sections` (POST), `/settings/sections/{section}` (DELETE), `/settings/subjects` (CRUD).

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/settings/`):
- `academic-year.blade.php` — table with Set as Current / Edit / Delete; Add & Edit via shared Alpine.js modal
- `classes.blade.php` — table; Add Class modal; Manage Sections modal (lists existing sections as removable chips + inline add form); re-opens automatically when `?class_open={id}` is set in URL after section add/delete; class data passed as JSON for Alpine
- `subjects.blade.php` — table with Edit / Delete; Add & Edit via shared Alpine.js modal

**Settings sub-nav** (Academic Year | Classes & Sections | Subjects) rendered inline at top of each settings page, no shared partial needed.

**Sidebar** (`components/sidebar-nav.blade.php`): Settings item added after Reports with `settings.manage` permission. Added `activeRoute` field to nav items so Settings highlights for all `tenant.settings.*` routes.

**DB unique constraints** (added 2026-06-14 via migration `000004`):
- `school_classes.name` — unique index (`school_classes_name_unique`)
- `school_classes.order` — unique index (`school_classes_order_unique`)
- `sections(class_id, name)` — composite unique index (`sections_class_id_name_unique`)
- `subjects.name` — unique index (`subjects_name_unique`)
- Migration deduplicates any existing duplicates before adding indexes (renames conflicts as "Name (2)", etc.)
- Pre-existing duplicate "Primary 6" on tenant `936d55b2` was renamed to "Primary 6 (2)"

**Form Request validation for uniqueness:**
- `StoreSchoolClassRequest` / `UpdateSchoolClassRequest`: name uses `Rule::unique` with message "A class named ':input' already exists."; order uses a closure with message "Order N is already used by 'ClassName' — choose a different order." (Update ignores current class ID)
- `StoreSectionRequest`: name unique per class_id using `Rule::unique(...)->where('class_id', ...)` with message "This class already has a section named ':input'."
- `StoreSubjectRequest` / `UpdateSubjectRequest` (new): name uses `Rule::unique` with message "A subject named ':input' already exists." `SubjectController::update` now uses `UpdateSubjectRequest` instead of `StoreSubjectRequest`.
- `SubjectController::update` switched from `StoreSubjectRequest` to `UpdateSubjectRequest` to correctly ignore the current subject on edit.

**Error display:** Both classes and subjects modals re-open automatically on validation failure using hidden `_class_mode`/`_class_id` and `_subject_mode`/`_subject_id` sentinel fields plus `old()` to restore form state. Section add form error shown inline above the section name input. `@error()` directives added to all affected form fields.

**Dashboard checklist** (`DashboardController`): Now checks live DB — `AcademicYear::exists()`, `SchoolClass::exists()`, `Subject::exists()`. Pending checklist items with links are now clickable anchors with a chevron icon. School profile check uses `DB::table('school_profile')->exists()`.

**Sections/Classes contract**: A class with no sections is a single implicit group — anywhere class/section is selected (students, attendance, timetable), the section selector is hidden or shows "N/A" if the chosen class has no sections. This is enforced in consumer views (Phase 08+).

**Subjects-to-classes linking**: Not added yet — no pivot table in the migrations. Subject-class assignments are deferred to timetable/exam mark entry (Phase 3/4) where the teacher selects a subject for a specific class.

---

### 08 — Student Management

**Models** created: `app/Models/Tenant/Student.php` — relationships to `SchoolClass`, `Section`, `User`.

**Migration fix**: Created `2026_06_14_000001_make_students_section_id_nullable.php` — `section_id` is nullable because classes with no defined sections are treated as a single implicit group (no section row exists for those students).

**Admission number format**: `{YEAR}/{SEQUENCE}` e.g. `2026/0001`. Auto-generated in `StudentController::generateAdmissionNumber()` using the highest existing admission_no for the current year. Stored on create; never editable.

**Controllers** updated: `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/StudentController.php` — full CRUD (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`) + `import()` (CSV via maatwebsite/excel) + `downloadTemplate()` (returns inline CSV).

**Form Requests** in `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/`: `StoreStudentRequest` (requires `students.create`), `UpdateStudentRequest` (requires `students.edit`), `ImportStudentsRequest` (requires `students.create`).

**Import class**: `app/Imports/StudentImport.php` — implements `ToCollection` + `WithHeadingRow`. Looks up class by name, then section by name within class. Errors collected per-row and surfaced as a flash message (first 5 shown). `imported` count returned for success/partial-success messaging.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Students group split into 4 permission tiers: `students.view` (index, template download, show), `students.create` (create, store, import POST), `students.edit` (edit, update), `students.delete` (destroy). Template and import POST are registered before `{student}` wildcard to prevent route collision.

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/students/`):
- `index.blade.php` — table with Admission No, Name, Class, Section (column hidden if no class has sections), Guardian Contact, Status badge. Filter bar: search, class select, section select (appears only when a class with sections is selected). Import modal with file upload + template download link.
- `create.blade.php` — three-card layout (Personal, Academic, Guardian). Section dropdown appears via Alpine.js only when selected class has sections (`x-show="currentSections.length > 0"`). Admission number field is read-only with format hint.
- `edit.blade.php` — same three-card layout as create; Status field included; Alpine pre-populates class/section from existing student data.
- `show.blade.php` — profile header (avatar initial, name, admission no, class/section/status badges, edit/delete actions). Four detail cards: Personal, Guardian, Academic, plus read-only placeholder cards for Attendance (Phase 3), Exam Results (Phase 4), Fee Status (Phase 5).

**Section conditional rule**: Section dropdown in create/edit forms is `x-show="currentSections.length > 0"` — visible only after a class with sections is selected. Section column in the index table is only rendered if at least one class has sections (`$anyClassHasSections`). Section value in list/profile shows "—" for students with no section_id.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply the `section_id` nullable migration to all existing tenant databases.

---

---

### 09 — Staff Management

**Models**: `app/Models/Tenant/Staff.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `user_id`, `full_name`, `role_title`, `phone`, `photo_path`, `status`. `user()` BelongsTo `Tenant\User`.

**Controllers**: `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/StaffController.php` — full CRUD (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`). `store()` and `update()` run in a `DB::transaction` that creates/updates both the `users` row and the `staff` row together.

**User account creation**: Each staff member has a linked `User` record created at the same time. The `store()` method creates the User (with `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` columns) and then calls `$user->assignRole($systemRole)` to set the spatie role. `destroy()` deletes the User first — the FK `onDelete('cascade')` in the `staff` migration cleans up the staff row automatically.

**Role assignment**: Staff can be assigned any spatie role except `school_admin`, `student`, `parent`. The `system_role` dropdown in the form loads from `Role::whereNotIn('name', ['school_admin','student','parent'])`. `update()` calls `$user->syncRoles([$systemRole])` to replace the old role.

**Password on edit**: The edit form has optional `new_password` / `new_password_confirmation` fields. If blank, the password is not changed. `UpdateStaffRequest` uses `nullable` + `required_with:new_password` rules.

**Email uniqueness**: `StoreStaffRequest` uses `unique:users,email`. `UpdateStaffRequest` uses `Rule::unique('users','email')->ignore($this->route('staff')?->user_id)` to exclude the current user's email.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Staff group split into 5 permission tiers: `staff.view` (index, show), `staff.create` (create, store), `staff.edit` (edit, update), `staff.delete` (destroy). Literal `/staff/create` registered before `{staff}` wildcard to avoid route conflicts.

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/staff/`):
- `index.blade.php` — table: avatar initial, Name (link to profile), Role Title, Email, System Role badge, Status badge. Filter bar: search (name/email), status select, clear link.
- `create.blade.php` — two-card layout: Personal Information (full_name, role_title, phone, status) + Login Account (email, password, password_confirmation, system_role with link to Manage Roles).
- `edit.blade.php` — two-card layout: Personal Information + Login Account (email, optional new_password, new_password_confirmation, system_role).
- `show.blade.php` — profile header card (avatar, name, role_title, status + system role badges, Edit/Delete actions). Staff Details card (phone, status, role_title, system_role, email). Two Phase 3 placeholder cards: Assigned Classes & Subjects, Attendance Record.

**Assigned classes/subjects**: Deferred to Phase 3 (timetable). Profile shows a placeholder card.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` if the `staff` table does not yet exist in tenant DBs. The migration is `000009_create_staff_table.php`.

---

### 09b — Custom Roles & Permissions

**Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/RolesPermissionsController.php` — `index()`, `store()`, `update(Role)`, `destroy(Role)`. Fixed roles (`school_admin`, `teacher`, `accountant`, `student`, `parent`) are blocked from edit/delete at the controller level.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Under `permission:settings.manage`: `GET /settings/roles` (index), `POST /settings/roles` (store), `PUT /settings/roles/{role}` (update), `DELETE /settings/roles/{role}` (destroy). Route model binding resolves `Role` from the tenant DB automatically (tenancy switches the default connection).

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/settings/roles.blade.php`):
- Settings sub-nav with Roles & Permissions as the 4th tab — also added to academic-year, classes, subjects views.
- Roles table: Role Name (with avatar icon), Permissions count, Type badge (Fixed/Custom), Actions (Edit/Delete for custom only).
- "Create Role" / "Edit Role" shared modal (single `<form>` with `:action` Alpine binding and `:value="mode === 'edit' ? 'PUT' : ''"` on a hidden `_method` field — empty string is falsy in PHP so Laravel skips the method override for add mode).
- Permission matrix inside the modal: 8 modules (Students, Staff, Attendance, Timetable, Exams, Fees, Announcements, Reports) each with per-action checkboxes. Per-module "Select all / Deselect all" toggle via `toggleModule(permsArray)`.
- Checkboxes use `x-model="form.permissions"` (Alpine 3 array binding) — no manual `:checked` / `@change` needed.
- Info card below the table explains how roles wire to the staff form.

**Staff form wiring**: No code change needed — `StaffController::create()` and `edit()` already query `Role::whereNotIn('name', ['school_admin','student','parent'])`, which automatically includes any custom roles created here.

**Permission validation**: `store()` and `update()` validate that submitted permission names exist in the `permissions` table (`exists:permissions,name`), so arbitrary permission names cannot be injected.

**No migration needed**: All tables (`roles`, `permissions`, `model_has_roles`, `model_has_permissions`, `role_has_permissions`) were created in Phase 04 migration `000002`. No new tables.

---

### 10 — Daily Attendance

**Models**: `app/Models/Tenant/Attendance.php` — fillable: `student_id`, `date`, `status`, `marked_by`, `note`. `date` cast to `date`. `app/Models/Tenant/StaffAttendance.php` — same shape but with `staff_id` FK.

**Migration**: `database/migrations/tenant/2026_06_14_000002_create_staff_attendances_table.php` — separate table for staff attendance (`staff_id + date` unique constraint, FK to `staff.id`). Student attendance uses the existing `attendances` table from Phase 05.

**Form Requests**: `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/SaveAttendanceRequest.php` (authorizes `attendance.edit`, validates date is before_or_equal:today, statuses array). `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/SaveStaffAttendanceRequest.php` (same pattern without class_id).

**Controllers** updated: `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/AttendanceController.php` — `index()`, `save()`, `report()`, `staff()`, `saveStaff()`. Save uses `Attendance::updateOrCreate(['student_id','date'], ['status','marked_by'])` — idempotent re-marking.

**Routes** added under `permission:attendance.view`: `GET /attendance/report` → `attendance.report`, `GET /attendance/staff` → `attendance.staff`. Under `permission:attendance.edit`: `POST /attendance` → `attendance.save`, `POST /attendance/staff` → `attendance.staff.save`.

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/attendance/`):
- `index.blade.php` — filter bar (class, conditional section, date, Load button); attendance sheet with P/A/L quick-action toggle buttons (Alpine `attendanceSheet` component); "Mark all present" bulk action; Save Attendance form POST. Read-only badge fallback for users without `attendance.edit`. Empty state when no class/date selected.
- `report.blade.php` — filter bar (class, section, student, month); summary stats (4 stat cards: present/absent/late/unmarked); monthly table (each past day as a row with status badge); prev/next month navigation.
- `staff.blade.php` — date selector; staff list with P/A/L toggle buttons; "Mark all present"; Save Staff Attendance. Same Alpine pattern as student attendance.

**Alpine pattern**: `attendanceSheet(students, existingRecords)` / `staffAttendanceSheet(staff, existingRecords)` initialized with server-side JSON. Statuses keyed by UUID. Toggle: clicking an active button deselects it (sets to null — existing DB record preserved, not deleted). Hidden `<input>` per row with `:value` binding carries status into form POST.

**Teacher class filter**: Teachers see all classes for now (timetable not built yet — Phase 11 will add assignment-based filtering). The controller is structured to add the filter later without structural changes.

**CSS token added**: `--color-warning-light: #fff7ed` added to `resources/css/app.css` `@theme` block — enables `bg-warning-light` and `border-warning` utility classes for Late status buttons/badges.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply the `staff_attendances` table to all existing tenant databases.

---

### 11 — Timetable / Routine Builder

**Migration**: `database/migrations/tenant/2026_06_14_000003_make_timetable_section_id_nullable.php` — makes `section_id` nullable via raw `ALTER TABLE` statement. MySQL allows NULL in FK columns without violating the FK constraint. The existing DB-level unique constraint `(class_id, section_id, day, period)` does not enforce uniqueness when `section_id` is NULL (MySQL NULL != NULL behavior), so app-level `updateOrCreate` enforces uniqueness for null-section classes.

**Model**: `app/Models/Tenant/Timetable.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `class_id`, `section_id`, `subject_id`, `teacher_id`, `day`, `period`, `start_time`, `end_time`. Relationships: `schoolClass()`, `section()`, `subject()`, `teacher()`.

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/TimetableController.php`):
- `index(Request)` — loads timetable grid for a class/section; uses `whereNull('section_id')` for classes without sections; passes entries keyed by `"Day-Period"` as JSON.
- `save(Request)` — validates input, checks conflict (same teacher in same day+period for a different class/section, excluding the current cell), uses `updateOrCreate` for idempotent saves, returns JSON `{ success, entry, conflict }`.
- `destroy(Timetable)` — deletes a cell entry, returns JSON.
- `teacher(Request)` — teacher's personal schedule; non-admins auto-load their own staff record; admins get a staff dropdown selector.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Under `permission:timetable.view`: `GET /timetable` + `GET /timetable/my`. Under `permission:timetable.edit`: `POST /timetable` (save) + `DELETE /timetable/{timetable}` (destroy).

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/timetable/`):
- `index.blade.php` — filter bar (class, conditional section); days-as-rows × periods-as-columns grid wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` for mobile scroll; filled cells show subject + teacher name in `bg-accent-muted`; empty cells show dashed border + "+" icon; Alpine `timetableGrid` component manages entries client-side; cell edits use `fetch()` POST (no page reload). Alpine store `timetableModal` shared between grid and modal panel. Conflict detection returns a warning banner (save still committed). Clear (×) button on filled cells sends DELETE. Read-only for users without `timetable.edit`.
- `teacher.blade.php` — read-only grid showing subject + class/section name for each filled cell; cells styled `bg-success-lightest`; admins see a staff dropdown selector; non-admins auto-load own schedule; footer shows period count + class count summary.

**Period configuration**: 8 periods (1–8), Mon–Fri, hardcoded for MVP. Times (`start_time`/`end_time`) columns exist in DB for future use but not surfaced in UI.

**Conflict detection**: Same teacher assigned to any other class/section in the same day+period → `conflict` message returned in JSON. Save still succeeds; conflict shown as a dismissible orange banner on the grid.

**Alpine pattern**: `timetableFilter` manages class/section filter dropdown state. `timetableGrid(entriesData, subjects, staff, classId, sectionId)` manages entries in a client-side map keyed by `"Day-Period"`, handles cell open/clear, communicates with `Alpine.store('timetableModal')`. Store pattern used so modal (rendered outside the grid `x-data` scope) can access and update grid state via `_gridRef`.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply the `section_id` nullable migration to all existing tenant databases.

### 12 — Exam Scheduling + Marks Entry

**Models**: `app/Models/Tenant/Exam.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `name`, `term`, `academic_year_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`. `academicYear()` BelongsTo, `results()` HasMany. `app/Models/Tenant/ExamResult.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `exam_id`, `student_id`, `subject_id`, `marks`, `grade`, `remarks`. Static `computeGrade(float)` returns A/B/C/D/F using the default scale (70/60/50/40 thresholds) — same scale as `ui-rules.md` grade colors.

**Form Requests**: `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/StoreExamRequest` (authorizes `exams.create`), `UpdateExamRequest` (authorizes `exams.edit`), `SaveMarksRequest` (authorizes `exams.edit`, validates `marks.*` as `nullable|numeric|min:0|max:100`).

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/ExamController.php`): `index()`, `store()`, `update(Exam)`, `destroy(Exam)`, `marks(Request)`, `saveMarks(SaveMarksRequest)`. `saveMarks()` uses `ExamResult::updateOrCreate` on the `[exam_id, student_id, subject_id]` triple — blank marks deletes the existing record.

**Teacher restriction**: `marks()` and `saveMarks()` check if the authenticated user has `settings.manage` (admin); if not, they verify the user's `Staff` record has a `Timetable` entry for the requested `class_id + section_id + subject_id` combination. `canManageAll` is passed to the view so Alpine can filter class/subject dropdowns for teachers. The teacher's assignments are passed as a flat JSON array `[{class_id, section_id, subject_id}]`.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): `GET /exams` (index, exams.view), `GET /exams/marks` (marks page, exams.view), `POST /exams` (store, exams.create), `PUT /exams/{exam}` (update, exams.edit), `POST /exams/marks` (saveMarks, exams.edit), `DELETE /exams/{exam}` (destroy, exams.delete). Literal `/exams/marks` registered before any future `{exam}` wildcard.

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/exams/`):
- `index.blade.php` — exam list table; Status badge (upcoming/ongoing/completed/published); Add/Edit via shared Alpine modal (`examsPage` component); "Enter Marks" link pre-fills `?exam_id=` on marks page; Delete via form POST with confirm dialog.
- `_form.blade.php` — shared form partial (name, term+status 2-col, academic year dropdown via Alpine template, start/end date 2-col). Used inside both add and edit modal `<form>` blocks.
- `marks.blade.php` — filter bar (exam, class, section conditional, subject); marks entry table wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` (`min-width:600px`); marks input (0–100, step 0.5); live grade badge + progress bar computed by `marksSheet` Alpine component; "Clear All" button; Save Marks form POST. Teacher mode: class/subject dropdowns filtered by `assignments` array via Alpine. Read-only badge fallback for users without `exams.edit`.

**Grade color invariant**: Grade A → `bg-success-lightest text-success-foreground`, B → `bg-info-lightest text-info-foreground`, C → `bg-warning-light text-warning` (inline `#FFF7ED` bg), D/F → `bg-error-light text-error`. Same tokens as `ui-tokens.md` grade color table.

**Action required**: No new migrations needed — `exams` and `exam_results` tables were already created in Phase 05 (migrations `000012` and `000013`). Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` only if those migrations haven't been applied yet.

---

### 13 — Grading Scale + Report Card Generation (PDF)

**Config**: `config/schoolflow.php` created with `default_grading_scale` array — 5 bands: A (70–100 Excellent), B (60–69 Very Good), C (50–59 Good), D (40–49 Pass), F (0–39 Fail). Matches the thresholds already in `ExamResult::computeGrade()` and `ui-rules.md`.

**ReportCardService** (`app/Services/ReportCardService.php`):
- `build(Exam, Student): array` — loads ExamResults for the student+exam, applies `config('schoolflow.default_grading_scale')`, computes overall average and average grade/remark. Returns data array including results collection (with bar_width, bar_color per row), student, exam, scale.
- `generatePdf(Exam, Student): string` — renders `tenant.exams.report-card-pdf` via `Pdf::loadView()` (barryvdh/laravel-dompdf), saves to `storage/{tenantId}/report-cards/{student_id}/{exam_id}.pdf` on the local disk, returns absolute path.
- Both methods have `try/catch`; `generatePdf` rethrows after logging so the controller can show the user a safe error.

**ReportCardController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/ReportCardController.php`):
- `preview(Request)` — filter bar page. Admins see all exams + a class/section/student dropdown chain. Students/parents see only published exams; their student record is auto-resolved via `Student::where('user_id', Auth::id())`.
- `download(Request)` — same access checks as preview, then calls `generatePdf()` and returns `response()->file()` with a sanitized filename.
- Injected via constructor: `ReportCardService`.

**Exam publish action** (`ExamController::publish(Exam)`):
- Route: `PATCH /exams/{exam}/publish` (requires `exams.edit`).
- Simply sets `status = 'published'` with a try/catch. One-way action (no "unpublish" in MVP — admin can revert via the Edit modal by changing status back to completed/ongoing).

**Routes added** in `routes/tenant.php` (all under `permission:exams.view`):
- `GET /exams/report-card` → `ReportCardController::preview` → `tenant.exams.report-card`
- `GET /exams/report-card/download` → `ReportCardController::download` → `tenant.exams.report-card.download`
- Under `permission:exams.edit`: `PATCH /exams/{exam}/publish` → `ExamController::publish` → `tenant.exams.publish`
- All literal paths registered before the `{exam}` wildcard to avoid route conflicts.

**Views** (`resources/views/tenant/exams/`):
- `report-card.blade.php` — preview page with filter bar (exam + class/section/student for admins, auto-filled student for students/parents), inline report card table (subject, marks, grade badge, remark, progress bar), overall average tfoot row, grading scale key footer. Download PDF + Print buttons in card header.
- `report-card-pdf.blade.php` — self-contained HTML/CSS for dompdf (DejaVu Sans, A4 portrait). Includes: school header, student info grid, results table with grade badges + inline progress bars, grading scale table, signature area. Uses only inline styles (no external CSS).

**Exams index updates** (`exams/index.blade.php`):
- Flash messages added (success/error) — were previously missing.
- "Report Cards" top button added next to "Enter Marks".
- Per-row: "Report Cards" link appears for `completed`/`published` exams. "Publish" button (with confirm dialog) appears for admins when status is not yet `published`. Both appear in the same actions column.

**Access control invariant**: Students/parents can never see unpublished results — enforced in both `ReportCardController::preview` and `::download` via the `$exam->status !== 'published'` check, independently of the query-time filter on the exam list. Double-layer protection.

**PDF storage path**: `storage/{tenantId}/report-cards/{student_id}/{exam_id}.pdf` on `local` disk. If the directory doesn't exist, `Storage::disk('local')->makeDirectory()` creates it before `put()`. No public URL is exposed — download goes via the controller which streams the file.

**Action required**: No new migrations needed. `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` (^3.1) was already in `composer.json`. Run `php artisan config:clear` to ensure `config/schoolflow.php` is picked up.

---

### 15 — Fee Collection (Cash)

**Model**: `app/Models/Tenant/FeePayment.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `student_id`, `fee_structure_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_method`, `paystack_ref`, `recorded_by`, `paid_at`. Casts: `amount` decimal:2, `paid_at` datetime. Relations: `student()`, `feeStructure()`, `recordedBy()` BelongsTo User.

**Service** (`app/Services/FeeService.php`):
- `getStudentFeeItems(Student, ?string $academicYearId, ?string $term): array` — loads fee_structures for student's class_id (filtered by year/term if provided), aggregates fee_payments per structure via a single query + groupBy, computes status per item. Returns array of `{fee_structure, paid_amount, outstanding, status, payments}`.
- `computeStatus(float $total, float $paid, ?Carbon $dueDate): string` — returns 'paid' (paid >= total), 'partial' (0 < paid < total, not overdue), 'overdue' (paid < total AND due_date is past), 'unpaid' (paid == 0, not overdue).
- `recordCashPayment(Student, FeeStructure, float $amount): array{success,data,error}` — creates FeePayment with payment_method='cash', paystack_ref=null, recorded_by=Auth::id(), paid_at=now(). Returns service result shape.

**Form Request**: `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/RecordPaymentRequest.php` — authorizes `fees.create`, validates `student_id` (uuid, exists:students), `fee_structure_id` (uuid, exists:fee_structures), `amount` (numeric, min:0.01).

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/FeeController.php`): Constructor injects `FeeService`. `index(Request)` dispatches: has `fees.view` → `adminView()`, else → `studentSelfView()`. `pay(RecordPaymentRequest)` computes outstanding, caps amount if above outstanding, calls service, redirects back to `?student_id&academic_year_id` with flash. CRUD redirects updated to `/fees?tab=structure`.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): `GET /fees` moved out of `permission:fees.view` group — now accessible to all authenticated users (controller dispatches). `POST /fees/pay` added under `permission:fees.create`.

**Sidebar** (`components/sidebar-nav.blade.php`): Fees permission changed from `fees.view` to `null` — now visible to all authenticated users including students/parents.

**Views**:
- `resources/views/tenant/fees/index.blade.php` — **redesigned** with two Alpine-managed tabs: "Fee Collection" (default) and "Fee Structure". Tab state initialized from `?tab=` URL param via `x-init="initTab('{{ $activeTab }}')"`. Fee Collection tab: search card (student name/adm no + academic year + term selects), search results list (click → loads student's fees), student info bar (name, class, total owed/paid/outstanding), fee items table with status badges + "Record Payment" button per outstanding item, Record Payment modal. Fee Structure tab: existing CRUD table + Add/Edit modal (moved from prior Feature 14 view). Three Alpine components: `feesAdminPage` (tab state), `feeStructureTab` (CRUD modal), `paymentModal` (Record Payment modal).
- `resources/views/tenant/fees/my-fees.blade.php` — **new** student/parent read-only view. Shows student summary header card (avatar, name, admission no, class, academic year), three-stat strip (total owed / paid / outstanding), fee items table (overflow-x-auto, Term/Paid/Outstanding columns hidden on small screens), totals tfoot row, info banner showing outstanding balance with instruction to contact school office. Empty state if no student record linked to user.

**Status computation invariant**: 'paid' takes precedence, then 'overdue' (paid < total AND due_date past — applies to both unpaid AND partial-paid items past due), then 'partial' (some paid, not due), then 'unpaid'. Computed dynamically from payment sums — never stored as an aggregate.

**Accountant permission note**: `pay()` requires `fees.create`. The default `accountant` role was seeded with only `fees.view`. To allow accountants to record payments, grant them `fees.create` via the Roles & Permissions settings page (or update TenantProvisioningService seeding for new tenants).

**No new migrations needed**: `fee_payments` table was created in Phase 05 (migration `000015`).

---

### 16 — Paystack Online Payment Integration

**Schema correction** (migration `000005_remove_status_from_fee_payments`): Dropped the stored `status` column from `fee_payments` — per architecture.md, status is computed from payment sums at runtime, never persisted. `FeePayment::$fillable` and `FeeStatusService::recordCashPayment` both updated to remove `status`.

**FeeStatusService** (`app/Services/FeeStatusService.php`): New service replacing `FeeService` (now dead code). Carries the same three methods — `getStudentFeeItems()`, `computeStatus()`, `recordCashPayment()`. All references in `FeeController` updated to inject `FeeStatusService` instead.

**PaystackService** (`app/Services/PaystackService.php`): Uses Guzzle (already in composer.json — no new SDK needed).
- `initializeTransaction(email, amount, callbackUrl, metadata, reference)` — POSTs to `api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize`; amount converted from major unit (GHS) to smallest unit (pesewas × 100) internally; returns `{success, authorization_url, reference, error}`.
- `verifyTransaction(reference)` — GETs `api.paystack.co/transaction/verify/{ref}`; converts amount back from pesewas; returns `{success, status, amount, metadata, error}`.
- `verifyWebhookSignature(rawPayload, signature)` — HMAC-SHA512 using the secret key; used by the webhook controller.

**config/paystack.php**: Reads `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`, `PAYSTACK_CURRENCY` (default `GHS`) from `.env`.

**PaystackWebhookController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/PaystackWebhookController.php`): Handles `POST /paystack/webhook`. Five-step flow: (1) verify HMAC signature, (2) only process `charge.success` events, (3) idempotency check (`paystack_ref` already recorded), (4) verify with Paystack API before writing anything, (5) create `fee_payments` row with `payment_method = 'paystack'`.

**FeeController updates**: Two new methods —
- `paystackCheckout()`: validates `student_id` + `fee_structure_id`, computes outstanding, calls `PaystackService::initializeTransaction()` with student email + metadata (`student_id`, `fee_structure_id`, `student_name`, `fee_item`), redirects away to Paystack authorization URL.
- `paystackCallback()`: called after Paystack redirects the user back. Checks idempotency first (webhook may have already recorded it), then falls back to `verifyTransaction()` and creates the `fee_payments` row.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`):
- `POST /paystack/webhook` — outside auth group, CSRF excluded via `->withoutMiddleware([\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class])`. Tenant resolved by subdomain (each school configures their subdomain as the Paystack webhook URL).
- `POST /paystack/checkout` — inside auth group, no permission gate (student/parent role can initiate).
- `GET /paystack/callback` — inside auth group, handles redirect back from Paystack checkout.

**my-fees.blade.php**: Added "Pay Now" column to the fee items table — visible for `unpaid`, `partial`, `overdue` items. Each "Pay Now" is a form POST to `/paystack/checkout` with hidden `student_id` + `fee_structure_id`. Updated the outstanding balance banner to say "Click Pay Now on any outstanding item to pay online via Paystack." Flash messages added (success, error, info).

**Paystack webhook URL**: Configure each tenant's Paystack webhook to `{subdomain}.schoolflow.com/paystack/webhook`. Signature is verified with `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` before any payload is trusted. Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply the `status` column removal. Add `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`, and optionally `PAYSTACK_CURRENCY` to `.env`.

---

### 07b — School Profile & Branding

**Model**: `app/Models/Tenant/SchoolProfile.php` — singleton table (`school_profile`), fillable: `school_name`, `logo_path`, `short_description`, `address`, `phone`, `email`, `website`.

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/SchoolProfileController.php`):
- `index()` — loads first (and only) `SchoolProfile` row, passes to view.
- `update(UpdateSchoolProfileRequest)` — upsert pattern: `SchoolProfile::first() ?? new SchoolProfile()`. If a logo file is uploaded, deletes the old file from `public` disk, stores the new one at `logos/{tenantId}/logo.{ext}`. Returns back with flash.

**Form Request**: `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/UpdateSchoolProfileRequest.php` — authorizes `settings.manage`. Logo validates as `image|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png,gif,webp,svg|max:2048`.

**Logo storage**: `Storage::disk('public')->storeAs("logos/{tenantId}", "logo.{ext}")`. URL in views: `asset('storage/' . $profile->logo_path)`. Requires `php artisan storage:link` (standard Laravel setup).

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Added `GET /settings/profile` and `POST /settings/profile` under `permission:settings.manage` middleware group.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/settings/school-profile.blade.php`): Settings sub-nav with "School Profile" tab active. Logo upload with live Alpine.js preview (`URL.createObjectURL`). Text fields: school_name (required), short_description (textarea), address, phone, email, website. All fields have `old()` fallback and `@error()` display. Same card-based layout as other settings pages.

**Settings sub-nav**: "School Profile" tab added to all 5 settings views (`academic-year`, `classes`, `subjects`, `roles`, `school-profile`). All sub-navs now have `overflow-x-auto` and `whitespace-nowrap` on tabs to handle 5 items on mobile.

**ViewComposer** (`app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`): Targets `layouts.tenant` and `tenant.auth.login`. Checks `tenancy()->initialized` before querying the `school_profile` table. Falls back to `null` in any Throwable (e.g., un-migrated tenant, central-domain request). Sets `$schoolProfile` on both views.

**Sidebar logo** (`resources/views/layouts/tenant.blade.php`): If `$schoolProfile->logo_path` set → shows `<img>` (36×36 object-contain). Otherwise → gradient icon fallback. School name: `$schoolProfile?->school_name ?? config('app.name')`.

**Login page** (`resources/views/tenant/auth/login.blade.php`): Same logo/name logic — shows school logo if uploaded, gradient fallback otherwise. Title: `$schoolProfile?->school_name ?? config('app.name')`.

**PDF retrofit** (`app/Services/ReportCardService.php`): In `generatePdf()`, loads `SchoolProfile::first()`. If `logo_path` is set, reads the file from `public` disk and base64-encodes it into a data URI (dompdf cannot fetch external URLs). Passes `$schoolProfile` and `$logoBase64` to the PDF view.

**PDF header** (`resources/views/tenant/exams/report-card-pdf.blade.php`): Conditionally renders `<img src="{{ $logoBase64 }}">` (44×44px) above the school name. School name: `$schoolProfile?->school_name ?? tenant('name') ?? 'School'`.

**Dashboard checklist** (`DashboardController.php`): "School profile set up" checklist item now has `'link' => $host . '/settings/profile'` (was `null`).

**Action required**: Run `php artisan storage:link` to make uploaded logos accessible via `/storage/...` URL. Add `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` / `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` to `.env` for Paystack features. Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` if `school_profile` table doesn't exist in existing tenant DBs.

---

### 17 — Receipts (PDF) + Due/Overdue Tracking

**ReceiptService** (`app/Services/ReceiptService.php`):
- `build(FeePayment): array` — loads payment + student + fee structure + school profile, builds data array including `receiptNo` (first 10 hex chars of UUID), `logoBase64` (same base64-encode pattern as `ReportCardService`).
- `generatePdf(FeePayment): string` — renders `tenant.fees.receipt-pdf` via dompdf, saves to `storage/{tenantId}/receipts/{student_id}/{payment_id}.pdf` on the local disk, returns absolute path. Rethrows on failure after logging.

**ReceiptController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/ReceiptController.php`):
- `download(Request, FeePayment)` — authorization: users with `fees.view` can download any receipt; otherwise checks `feePayment->student->user_id === Auth::id()` (student/parent self-service). Returns file response with content-disposition `attachment`.
- Route: `GET /fees/receipt/{feePayment}` registered before the `{feeStructure}` wildcard routes to avoid conflicts.

**Receipt PDF** (`resources/views/tenant/fees/receipt-pdf.blade.php`):
- Self-contained HTML/CSS for dompdf (DejaVu Sans, A4 portrait). School logo (base64) or text-only header if `logo_path` null. Includes: status banner (PAYMENT CONFIRMED), amount box, two-column student/payment detail cards, fee breakdown table, signature area, footer note.
- Method badge: Paystack → cyan `bg-paystack-light text-info-foreground` style; Cash → grey surface badge.

**Overdue highlighting** (both views):
- Fee item rows with `status === 'overdue'` get `border-l-2 border-error bg-error-light/30` row class plus a warning triangle icon next to the fee item name.
- Due date text turns red with "· Overdue" suffix for overdue items.
- `my-fees.blade.php`: overdue items show a red "X overdue fee items" banner above the existing outstanding balance banner (overdue and outstanding banners are mutually exclusive; overdue takes priority).

**Receipt download links**:
- In the admin fee collection view (`index.blade.php`): after "Record Payment" button, iterates `$item['payments']` to render a download link per payment showing the amount.
- In the student view (`my-fees.blade.php`): same pattern — receipt link per payment in the actions column.

**Dashboard "Fees Collected This Term" stat** (`DashboardController`):
- `fees_this_term` = `FeePayment::whereHas('feeStructure', fn($q) => $q->where('term_id', $currentTerm->id))->sum('amount')` — actual money received.
- `fees_outstanding` = sum of (fs.amount − total_paid_for_that_structure) across all fee structures in the current term. Note: this is per-structure, not per-student; refined to per-student in Phase 7 Fee Reports.
- `overdue_count` = count of fee structures in current term where `due_date < today` AND some amount is still outstanding. Displayed as a red `⚠ N overdue` badge on the stat card (both admin and accountant views).
- Stat display changed from `₦{value/1000}k` format (mock) to `number_format($value, 2)` (real amounts).
- Both "Fees This Term" stat card (admin) and "Outstanding" card (accountant) now show the overdue badge when `overdue_count > 0`.

**Action required**: No new migrations needed. Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` only if `fee_structures` or `fee_payments` migrations haven't been applied yet.

---

### 18 — Announcements / Notice Board

**Migration**: `database/migrations/tenant/000016_create_announcements_table.php` — `id` (uuid PK), `title` (varchar 150), `body` (text), `posted_by` (FK→users), `is_public` (boolean, default false), timestamps.

**Model**: `app/Models/Tenant/Announcement.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `title`, `body`, `posted_by`, `is_public`. Cast: `is_public` boolean. Relationship: `postedBy()` BelongsTo `User` (FK `posted_by`).

**Form Requests**: `StoreAnnouncementRequest` (authorizes `announcements.create`) + `UpdateAnnouncementRequest` (authorizes `announcements.edit`). Both validate: `title` (required, string, max:150), `body` (required, string, max:5000), `is_public` (boolean).

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/AnnouncementController.php`): Full CRUD — `index()` (latest-first, eager-loads `postedBy`), `store()`, `update(Announcement)`, `destroy(Announcement)`. All mutations have try/catch + flash messages.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): `GET /announcements` (all auth users — no permission gate), `POST /announcements` (announcements.create), `PUT /announcements/{announcement}` (announcements.edit), `DELETE /announcements/{announcement}` (announcements.delete). Separate permission gates per verb — public read is intentional.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/announcements/index.blade.php`):
- Page header: count subtitle + "Add Announcement" button (gated by `announcements.create`).
- Card-per-announcement layout (not a table — body text needs space). Card header: icon, title, date, posted-by, Public/Staff-Only badge, edit/delete actions. Card body: body text with "Read more / Show less" expand (Alpine per-card `x-data`). Truncates at 240 chars server-side with a toggle button.
- Alpine `announcementsPage(announcements)` component: `showModal`, `mode` (add/edit), `form.{id,title,body,is_public}`, `openAdd()`, `openEdit(data)`, `close()`. Dual `<form>` inside modal (one for add, one for edit) — `x-show` switches between them.
- Empty state: icon + text + "Post First Announcement" CTA.
- Flash messages: success (green) and error (red) panels.

**Dashboard Recent Activity wiring** (`DashboardController::index()`):
- Replaced mock `$activity` array with real data: latest 3 `Announcement` rows + latest 2 `FeePayment` rows, merged into a single collection sorted by `created_at` descending.
- Each entry: `{type, text, time (diffForHumans), ts (Carbon)}`.
- `$recentAnnouncements` (top 3 announcements, with `postedBy`) passed separately for the student/parent "Recent Announcements" panel — replaces hardcoded mock in that panel.

**Student/parent dashboard "Recent Announcements" panel**: Now renders real `$recentAnnouncements` (Announcement models) — shows title, `diffForHumans()`, and `Str::limit($ann->body, 120)`. Shows "No announcements yet." empty state when empty.

**is_public field**: Now active — Feature 19 `PublicPageController` queries `Announcement::where('is_public', true)` so only flagged announcements appear on the public page.

**No new migrations needed to run**: Migration `000016` was already planned in Phase 05 schema. Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` if tenant DBs pre-date this session.

---

### 19 — Auto-Generated School Public Page

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/PublicPageController.php`): `index()` loads `SchoolProfile::first()` and `Announcement::where('is_public', true)->latest()->limit(5)->get()`. Passes `$profile` and `$announcements` to the view.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/public-page.blade.php`): Standalone self-contained HTML (no `@extends` — no sidebar or tenant layout). Sections:
- **Navbar**: sticky, `bg-surface border-b border-border h-16`. School logo (from `storage/` public disk) or blue gradient icon fallback. School name. "Login" button linking to `route('tenant.login')`.
- **Hero card**: School logo (96×96, rounded-2xl) or gradient icon (80×80). School name as `<h1>`. Short description paragraph. Inline contact strip (address / phone / email) with icon + clickable `tel:` and `mailto:` links.
- **Announcements section**: `<article>` cards per public announcement — icon badge, title, date (`d M Y`), body (truncated at 300 chars with "… Login to read more" hint). Empty state with icon when none published.
- **Contact Us card**: Separate full card below announcements listing address / phone / email / website, each with a colored icon, `<dt>/<dd>` pattern, clickable links. Only rendered if at least one contact field is set on the profile.
- **Footer**: `© {year} {school_name}` + "Powered by SchoolFlow".

**SEO** (all per-tenant, never generic):
- `<title>` = `$profile->school_name` (falls back to `tenant('name')` → `config('app.name')`)
- `<meta name="description">` = `short_description` if set; else auto-built from school name + address
- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">` — explicitly indexable
- OpenGraph: `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (logo URL if set)
- Twitter Card: `summary_large_image` (with logo) or `summary` (without)

**robots.txt**: `GET /robots.txt` route added to `routes/tenant.php` (unauthenticated, within the tenant domain group). Returns `User-agent: * / Allow: / / Disallow: /dashboard / Disallow: /students …` — all authenticated routes disallowed, public page explicitly allowed. Named `tenant.robots`.

**Route**: `GET /` → `PublicPageController::index` → named `tenant.public`. Already existed as a stub; now wired with real data. No authentication or permission gate — fully public.

**No new migrations needed**: All data comes from `school_profile` (Feature 07b) and `announcements` (Feature 18). No new tables or migrations.

**Graceful empty states**: If `school_profile` row doesn't exist (unprovision state), all fields null-safe (`$profile?->school_name`). If no public announcements, empty-state card shown. Contact Us card is conditionally rendered only when at least one contact field is set.

---

### 20 — Attendance & Fee Reports

**AttendanceReportService** (`app/Services/AttendanceReportService.php`): `build(classId, sectionId, dateFrom, dateTo)` loads all students in class (filtered by section if provided), loads all `attendances` records in the date range, groups by `student_id`, computes present/absent/late counts + `percent_present` (based on days marked, not calendar days). Returns standard `['success', 'data', 'error']` shape.

**ReportController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/ReportController.php`): Replaced the stub. Methods: `index()` (two-tab page with inline report data when filters filled), `attendancePdf()`, `attendanceExcel()`, `feesPdf()`, `feesExcel()`. PDF generation uses `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf`; Excel uses `maatwebsite/excel`. Fee PDF is landscape (A4); attendance PDF is portrait.

**Fee Collection Report** (inline in controller via `buildFeeReport(termId)`): Loads all `fee_structures` for the selected term, counts active students per class in a single grouped query (no N+1), sums `fee_payments` per fee_structure_id in a single grouped query. Computes expected = `amount × student_count`, outstanding = expected − collected. Totals row included in table and exports.

**Export classes** (`app/Exports/`): `AttendanceReportExport` — FromCollection, WithHeadings, ShouldAutoSize, WithTitle. `FeeCollectionReportExport` — same interfaces; includes a TOTAL row appended to collection.

**Routes** added under `permission:reports.view`: `GET /reports/attendance/pdf` → `reports.attendance.pdf`, `GET /reports/attendance/excel` → `reports.attendance.excel`, `GET /reports/fees/pdf` → `reports.fees.pdf`, `GET /reports/fees/excel` → `reports.fees.excel`. All literal paths within the same `permission:reports.view` group as `/reports`.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/reports/index.blade.php`): Two-tab layout (Attendance Report | Fee Collection). Alpine `reportsPage(classes, selectedClassId, selectedSectionId, activeTab)` manages tab switching and conditional section dropdown. Filter forms use `GET` with `?tab=` hidden input — submits reload the page with report data. Export buttons are anchor links with query params forwarded from the current filter state. No data loaded = empty-state card shown.

**PDF templates** (`resources/views/tenant/reports/attendance-pdf.blade.php`, `fees-pdf.blade.php`): Self-contained dompdf HTML (DejaVu Sans, inline CSS only). Both include school header (logo base64 or text-only), meta block (class/period or term/year), and the same data table as the inline view. School logo base64 encoding uses the same `encodeLogoBase64()` helper as ReportCardService. Attendance PDF: portrait; Fee PDF: landscape.

**% Present calculation**: Based on `total_marked` (days attendance was recorded for the student), not on calendar days. A student marked 45/50 days shows 90% even if the date range spans 90 calendar days.

**Access**: All 5 report routes gated by `permission:reports.view`. By default, `school_admin` and `accountant` roles have this permission (seeded in TenantProvisioningService).

### 14 — Fee Structure Setup

**Model**: `app/Models/Tenant/FeeStructure.php` — `HasUuids`, fillable: `class_id`, `academic_year_id`, `term`, `fee_item`, `amount`, `due_date`. Relationships: `schoolClass()` BelongsTo `SchoolClass`, `academicYear()` BelongsTo `AcademicYear`. `amount` cast to `decimal:2`, `due_date` cast to `date`.

**Form Requests**: `app/Http/Requests/Tenant/StoreFeeStructureRequest.php` (authorizes `fees.create`), `UpdateFeeStructureRequest.php` (authorizes `fees.edit`). Both validate: `class_id` (uuid, exists), `academic_year_id` (uuid, exists), `term` (required string max 50), `fee_item` (required string max 100), `amount` (required numeric min 0), `due_date` (nullable date).

**Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/FeeController.php`): Full CRUD — `index()` (loads fee structures with eager-loaded class + academic year, ordered by year → class → term → fee item), `store(StoreFeeStructureRequest)`, `update(UpdateFeeStructureRequest, FeeStructure)`, `destroy(FeeStructure)`. All mutation methods have try/catch returning human-readable errors.

**Routes** (`routes/tenant.php`): Extended fees routes block — `GET /fees` (fees.view), `POST /fees` (fees.create), `PUT /fees/{feeStructure}` (fees.edit), `DELETE /fees/{feeStructure}` (fees.delete).

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/fees/index.blade.php`):
- Page header with total count + "Add Fee Item" button (gated by `fees.create`).
- Table wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` → `min-width: 640px`. Columns: Class, Term, Academic Year, Fee Item, Amount, Due Date (hidden below `md:`), Actions.
- Add/Edit via shared Alpine modal (`max-w-lg`). Form fields: Class + Term (2-col on md+), Academic Year, Fee Item, Amount + Due Date (2-col on md+). Edit form uses `<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">` with `:action` template literal binding.
- `feeStructurePage(classes, academicYears)` Alpine component manages modal state. `openEdit(data)` spreads the row data into `form`. `openAdd()` resets form to empty defaults.
- Permission gates: `@can('fees.create')` on Add button and empty-state CTA, `@can('fees.edit')` on Edit button, `@can('fees.delete')` on Delete form.
- Flash messages: success (green) + error (red) using same token/pattern as other pages.
- Terms hardcoded to Term 1/2/3 — sufficient for MVP; easily extended.
- Empty state: icon + descriptive text + Add Fee Item CTA.

**No new migrations needed**: `fee_structures` table was created in Phase 05 (migration `000014`).

### 21 — Super Admin Dashboard — Manage Tenants & Subscriptions

**Migration** (`database/migrations/2026_06_15_000001_update_subscription_plans_for_per_student_billing.php`): Dropped `plan_name` and `renews_at` columns. Added `rate_per_student` (decimal 8,2), `student_count` (unsigned int, default 0), `student_count_synced_at` (timestamp nullable), `amount_due` (decimal 10,2), `payment_status` (string, default 'unpaid'), `cycle_start` (date nullable), `cycle_end` (date nullable). Existing `status` column kept (trial/active/expired semantics).

**Migration** (`database/migrations/2026_06_15_000002_create_super_admins_table.php`): New `super_admins` table (uuid PK, name, email unique, password, remember_token, timestamps).

**Config** (`config/schoolflow.php`): `default_rate_per_student` added — reads `DEFAULT_RATE_PER_STUDENT` env var, defaults to 5.00 GHS.

**Models**:
- `app/Models/Central/SubscriptionPlan.php` — central connection, fillable billing fields, `isExpired()` / `isPaid()` helpers, `tenant()` BelongsTo.
- `app/Models/Central/SuperAdmin.php` — central connection, `super_admins` table, `super_admin` guard, `HasUuids`.
- `app/Models/Central/Tenant.php` — added `subscriptionPlan()` HasOne relationship.

**Auth config** (`config/auth.php`): Added `super_admin` guard (session driver, `super_admins` provider) and `super_admins` provider (Eloquent, `SuperAdmin` model).

**TenantProvisioningService** (`app/Services/TenantProvisioningService.php`): After creating Domain, now creates a `SubscriptionPlan` row with `status=trial`, `rate_per_student=config('schoolflow.default_rate_per_student')`, `student_count=0`, `payment_status=unpaid`, `cycle_start=today`, `cycle_end=+1 year`.

**SyncTenantStudentCounts command** (`app/Console/Commands/SyncTenantStudentCounts.php`): Loops all tenants via `Tenant::all()`, inside each uses `$tenant->run()` to count `students` table rows, updates `subscription_plans.student_count`, `student_count_synced_at`, and recomputes `amount_due = rate_per_student × student_count`. Also auto-sets `status = expired` for tenants where `payment_status = unpaid` and `cycle_end` is in the past. Signature: `schoolflow:sync-student-counts`.

**Scheduler** (`app/Console/Kernel.php`): `$schedule->command('schoolflow:sync-student-counts')->daily()`.

**Tenant login blocking** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`): After `$request->authenticate()`, checks `tenant()->status === 'suspended'` (logs out + returns error) and `SubscriptionPlan::where('tenant_id', tenant()->id)->first()->status === 'expired'` (logs out + returns error). Both checks happen before `session()->regenerate()`.

**Auto-expire on dashboard load** (`SuperAdminController::index()`): Runs a bulk update to set `status = expired` for any `subscription_plans` rows where `payment_status = unpaid`, `cycle_end < today`, and `status != expired`. Fires every time the dashboard is loaded — a lightweight safety net between daily scheduler runs.

**Controllers** (`app/Http/Controllers/Central/`):
- `SuperAdminAuthController` — `showLogin()`, `login()` (validates, `Auth::guard('super_admin')->attempt()`), `logout()`.
- `SuperAdminController` — `index()` (auto-expire + load tenants with `subscriptionPlan` eager-loaded + stats), `toggleStatus(Tenant)`, `updateRate(Request, Tenant)` (also recomputes `amount_due`), `markPaid(Request, Tenant)` (sets `payment_status=paid`, `status=active`, updates `cycle_start`/`cycle_end`, also enables tenant if suspended), `markUnpaid(Tenant)`.

**Routes** (`routes/web.php`): Super Admin auth routes (login GET/POST, logout POST) + protected group under `auth:super_admin` middleware with prefix `super-admin` and name prefix `super-admin.`: dashboard (GET /), toggle (PATCH /tenants/{tenant}/toggle), rate (PATCH /tenants/{tenant}/rate), mark-paid (PATCH /tenants/{tenant}/mark-paid), mark-unpaid (PATCH /tenants/{tenant}/mark-unpaid).

**Views** (`resources/views/central/super-admin/`):
- `login.blade.php` — standalone page (no central layout, no navbar/footer). SchoolFlow logo + "Super Admin Portal" subtitle. Email/password/remember-me form. Error display. Back link to home.
- `dashboard.blade.php` — standalone page with inline topbar (SchoolFlow brand + super admin name + Sign Out). 4 global stats (total schools, active, expired, total unpaid amount due). Schools table with: School name/domain/join date, student count + "last synced" timestamp, rate per student (click-to-edit pencil icon), amount due (red when unpaid), payment status badge, cycle end date (red when past due), subscription status badge, account status badge, Suspend/Enable + Mark Paid/Mark Unpaid actions. Two Alpine.js modals: Edit Rate (number input, PATCH on submit) and Mark Paid (cycle_start/cycle_end date inputs, PATCH on submit). Alpine component `superAdminPage()` manages modal state inline. No Blade `@extends` — fully self-contained HTML for clean isolation from central app navbar/footer.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan migrate` on the central DB to apply both new migrations. Create first Super Admin via `php artisan tinker`: `\App\Models\Central\SuperAdmin::create(['name'=>'Admin','email'=>'admin@schoolflow.com','password'=>bcrypt('password')])`. Then run `php artisan schoolflow:sync-student-counts` to populate student counts for existing tenants.

### 2026-06-15 — Bug Fixes & Retroactive Form Submission Rules

**Bug 1 — Academic Year unique constraint (Feature 07)**:
- Added migration `2026_06_15_000003_add_unique_index_to_academic_years_name.php` — deduplicates and adds `UNIQUE` index on `academic_years.name`.
- `StoreAcademicYearRequest` and `UpdateAcademicYearRequest` — added `Rule::unique('academic_years','name')` (update variant uses `->ignore($this->route('academicYear'))`). Added `messages()` returning `'name.unique' => "An academic year named ':input' already exists."`.
- `academic-year.blade.php` — added `submitting` state + `@submit` handler to all four forms (add year, edit year, add term, edit term); buttons disable with "Saving…" text while submitting. Modals re-open on validation failure using hidden `_modal_mode`/`_modal_id` sentinel fields + `old()` restoration in `init()`. Added missing `@error` directives to edit year form fields.

**Bug 2 — Custom Roles not appearing after creation (Feature 09b)**:
- `RolesPermissionsController` — changed all three redirect calls from `redirect()->route('tenant.settings.roles')` to `redirect(request()->getSchemeAndHttpHost() . '/settings/roles')`. Root cause: `route()` helper requires the `subdomain` parameter to resolve correctly in stancl/tenancy's subdomain routing.
- `roles.blade.php` — added flash message HTML (success/error), added `submitting` state + `@submit` handler, added `close()` reset of `submitting`.

**Bug 3 — School Profile logo preview not showing after upload (Feature 07b)**:
- `SchoolProfileController::index()` — now computes `$logoUrl` via `Storage::disk('public')->url($profile->logo_path)` and passes to view.
- `SchoolProfileController::update()` — changed `return back()` to `redirect(request()->getSchemeAndHttpHost() . '/settings/profile')` for a reliable explicit redirect.
- `school-profile.blade.php` — `x-data` now uses `$logoUrl` variable instead of inline `asset()` call. Added `submitting` state + button disable.

**Retroactive Form Submission Rules — all remaining forms**:
Applied consistent submit-disable pattern (Alpine `submitting` state, `@submit="submitting = true"`, `:disabled="submitting"`, loading text) and flash message rendering across:
- `settings/classes.blade.php` — add class, edit class, add section forms + flash messages added
- `settings/subjects.blade.php` — add and edit subject modal forms
- `students/create.blade.php`, `students/edit.blade.php`
- `staff/create.blade.php`, `staff/edit.blade.php`
- `exams/index.blade.php` — add exam and edit exam modal forms; `examsPage` component gains `submitting` + `close()` reset
- `fees/index.blade.php` — fee structure add/edit modal (`feeStructureTab` component gains `submitting` + `close()` reset) and payment modal (`paymentModal` component gains `submitting` + `close()` reset)

**Migration action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply `2026_06_15_000003_add_unique_index_to_academic_years_name.php`.

---

### 2026-06-15 — Copy Term Structure from Previous Year (Feature 07 enhancement)

**New feature — "Copy term structure from previous year" button (Academic Year settings)**:
- `AcademicYearController::copyTerms()` — finds the most recently started other academic year that has at least one term, computes the signed day offset between the two years' `start_date` values, and bulk-creates copies of each source term (same `name`, dates shifted by offset, `is_current = false`) inside a DB transaction. Redirects back to the terms modal with a success/error flash.
- `routes/tenant.php` — added `POST /settings/academic-year/{academicYear}/copy-terms` → `copyTerms` (inside `permission:settings.manage` group).
- `academic-year.blade.php` — Terms modal empty-state section now includes a "Copy term structure from previous year" button, rendered via nested `<template x-if>`. The inner template checks `years.some(y => y.id !== termsYear.id && y.terms.length > 0)` — only visible when at least one other year has terms. Button is a form POST to the copy-terms route. Disappears once the year has terms (button is inside the zero-terms empty-state `x-if`).

---

### 2026-06-16 — Feature 07 Rebuild: Academic Calendar + Period System

**New migrations** (`database/migrations/tenant/`):
- `2026_06_16_000001_add_period_system_to_school_profile.php` — adds `period_system` string (default `'3_term'`) to `school_profile`.
- `2026_06_16_000002_make_terms_dates_nullable.php` — makes `terms.start_date` and `terms.end_date` nullable so auto-generated terms can be created without dates.

**Model updates**:
- `SchoolProfile` — added `period_system` to `$fillable`.

**Controller** (`AcademicYearController`):
- `index()` — now loads and passes `$schoolProfile` to the view.
- `store()` — wrapped in `DB::transaction`; auto-generates Term 1/2/3 or Semester 1/2 rows based on `school_profile.period_system`.
- `setPeriodSystem()` — new method; validates `period_system`, blocks change if terms already exist, calls `SchoolProfile::updateOrCreate`.
- `copyTerms()` — handles nullable term dates gracefully.

**Form Request**: `UpdateTermRequest` — `start_date` and `end_date` now nullable.

**Route**: `POST /settings/academic-year/period-system` added before copy-terms (literal before wildcard).

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/settings/academic-year.blade.php`) — **full rebuild**:
- Section 1: Period System — two form-POST cards (3-Term / 2-Semester); selected card highlighted in `bg-accent`.
- Section 2: Academic Years — pill buttons row; clicking a pill shows inline year panel with meta info, Set as Current / Edit / Delete actions, and terms list. Each term row has "Set Active" + "Edit Dates" inline form (no modal, no separate Terms tab). "Copy term structure from previous year" button in empty-terms state.
- Section 3: Active Configuration — shows current year name, period system label, current term name and date range.
- Alpine: `academicYearPage(yearsData, yearOpen)` — `selectedYearId`, `selectedYear` getter, `editingTermId`, `termForm`, modal re-open on validation error via `init()`.
- Sub-nav label: "Academic Year" → **"Academic Calendar"** (active tab in this view).

**Sub-nav label** updated to "Academic Calendar" in all 4 other settings views (`classes`, `subjects`, `roles`, `school-profile`).

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply the two new migrations.

---

### 2026-06-16 — Feature 14 Rebuild: Fee Structure with Target Classes & Mandatory Flag

**New migration** (`database/migrations/tenant/`):
- `2026_06_16_000003_update_fee_structures_add_target_class.php` — adds `target_class` string (default `'all'`) and `is_mandatory` boolean (default `true`); migrates existing `class_id` UUID data into `target_class`; drops FK and `class_id` column.

**Model updates** (`FeeStructure`):
- Replaced `class_id` with `target_class` in `$fillable`; added `is_mandatory`.
- Added `'is_mandatory' => 'boolean'` to `$casts`.
- Removed `schoolClass()` BelongsTo (target_class is not a FK).

**Form Requests** (`StoreFeeStructureRequest`, `UpdateFeeStructureRequest`):
- Removed `class_id`; added `target_class` (required, string, max:100) and `is_mandatory` (boolean).

**FeeStatusService** — `getStudentFeeItems()` now filters by `target_class = 'all' OR target_class = student.class_id` instead of `class_id = student.class_id`.

**FeeController** (`adminView()`):
- `$feeStructures` query: removed `schoolClass` eager load, removed `orderBy('class_id')`.
- Passes `$currentYear` (current academic year) and `$currentYearTerms` (terms for current year) to view.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/fees/index.blade.php`) — fee structure tab updated:
- Table columns: Fee Name | Amount | Target Classes | Term | Mandatory | Due Date | Actions.
- "Target Classes" cell: `'all'` → "All Classes" pill; otherwise resolves class name via `$classes->firstWhere('id', …)`.
- "Mandatory" cell: Yes (red pill) / No (grey pill).
- "Add Fee Item" → **"Configure New Fee"** (header button + empty-state button).
- Modal title: "Configure New Fee" / "Edit Fee".
- Modal fields: Fee Name → Amount → Target Classes dropdown → Academic Year (read-only) + Academic Term (only current year's terms) → Mandatory toggle + Due Date.
- Alpine `feeStructureTab(classes, currentYearTerms, currentYearName)`: updated form fields (`target_class`, `is_mandatory`), updated `init()` old() restoration, `openEdit()` passes `target_class`/`is_mandatory`.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply `2026_06_16_000003_update_fee_structures_add_target_class.php`.

---

---

### 2026-06-16 — Bulk Import Retrofit (Features 08 + 09) + Account Settings (09c)

**09c Account Settings — "My Account"**:
- Migration `2026_06_16_000004_add_phone_avatar_path_to_users.php` — adds `phone` (string, nullable) and `avatar_path` (string, nullable) to `users`.
- `User` model — `phone` and `avatar_path` added to `$fillable`.
- `UpdateAccountRequest`, `UpdatePasswordRequest` form requests (new).
- `AccountController` — `edit()`, `update()`, `updatePassword()`, `avatar()`. Avatar stored at `avatars/{tenantId}/{userId}/avatar.{ext}` on `public` disk, served via `/account/avatar` route.
- Routes (inside auth, no permission gate): `GET/PATCH /account`, `PUT /account/password`, `GET /account/avatar`.
- Topbar dropdown — avatar or initials trigger, user info block, "My Account" link, sign out form. Alpine `x-data` with `@click.outside` close.
- `resources/views/tenant/account/edit.blade.php` — two independent card forms (Profile + Password). Avatar preview persists after save. Per-section error display.

**Features 08 + 09 — Student & Staff Bulk Import Retrofit**:
- Migration `2026_06_16_000005_add_medical_notes_to_students.php` — adds `medical_notes` (text, nullable) to `students`.
- `StudentImportTemplate` (new) — `FromArray + WithStyles + WithTitle`; 9 columns including Medical Notes; blue header row, greyed italic example row; `.xlsx`.
- `StaffImportTemplate` (new) — `FromArray + WithStyles + WithTitle`; 5 columns (Full Name, Email, Phone, Role, Role Title); same styling.
- `StudentImport` (full rewrite) — `ToCollection + WithHeadingRow`. Two-pass: Pass 1 validates all rows (required fields, class/section existence, gender enum, batch dedup), collects all errors. Pass 2 runs only if zero errors, inside `DB::transaction()`.
- `StaffImport` (new) — same two-pass approach. Valid roles exclude `school_admin/student/parent`. Temp passwords format `'SF' . strtoupper(Str::random(6)) . rand(10,99)`. Collects `credentials[]` array for display after import.
- `ImportStudentsRequest` updated — field renamed `csv_file` → `import_file`, mimes `xlsx,csv`, max 5120.
- `ImportStaffRequest` (new) — same structure, authorizes `staff.create`.
- `StudentController::import()` — uses `import_file`, stores `student_import_errors` session on failure.
- `StudentController::downloadTemplate()` — returns `Excel::download(new StudentImportTemplate(), 'schoolflow-students-import-template.xlsx')`.
- `StaffController::import()` — stores `staff_import_errors` session on failure; on success stores `staff_import_credentials` session.
- `StaffController::downloadTemplate()` — returns `Excel::download(new StaffImportTemplate(), 'schoolflow-staff-import-template.xlsx')`.
- Routes — `GET /students/import/template`, `POST /students/import` (already existed); `GET /staff/import/template` (new), `POST /staff/import` (new).
- `students/index.blade.php` — import errors display, redesigned import modal (Step 1 download + Step 2 upload), `import_file` field, submit-disable.
- `staff/index.blade.php` — import errors display, credentials table (temp passwords after import), import modal (Step 1 download + Step 2 upload), `import_file` field, submit-disable.

**Import rule invariant**: Zero-tolerance two-pass approach — if any row fails validation, zero rows are imported and all errors are listed. Never partial imports.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply migrations `000004` (users phone/avatar) and `000005` (students medical_notes).

---

### 2026-06-16 — Feature 14 + 17: Billing Cycle (Annual Fees) + Term Bill PDF

**New migration** (`database/migrations/tenant/`):
- `2026_06_16_000006_add_billing_cycle_to_fee_structures.php` — adds `billing_cycle` (string, default `'term'`) after `term_id`, and `academic_year_id` (uuid, nullable, FK → `academic_years` with `nullOnDelete`) after `billing_cycle`.

**Model** (`FeeStructure`):
- Added `billing_cycle` and `academic_year_id` to `$fillable`.
- Added `academicYear()` BelongsTo relationship.

**Form Requests** (`StoreFeeStructureRequest`, `UpdateFeeStructureRequest`):
- Added `billing_cycle` (required, in:term,annual) and `academic_year_id` (nullable, uuid, exists:academic_years,id) rules.

**FeeStatusService** — `getStudentFeeItems()` rewritten to handle both billing cycles:
- When `$termId` provided: queries per-term fees (`billing_cycle='term'`, `term_id=$termId`) ORed with annual fees (`billing_cycle='annual'`, `academic_year_id=term's academic year`). Legacy rows with null `billing_cycle` fall through on term match.
- When `$termId` null: queries all per-term fees plus annual fees for the current academic year. Falls back to unrestricted query if no current year found.
- Payment status computation is unchanged — annual fee status is naturally correct since payments are summed across all `fee_payments` records for that `fee_structure_id`.

**FeeController** updates:
- Added imports: `AcademicYear`, `SchoolProfile`, `Pdf` facade, `Storage`, `SymfonyResponse`.
- `adminView()`: updated `$feeStructures` query to eager-load `academicYear`; added `$currentTerm = Term::where('is_current', true)->first()`; passes `$currentTerm` to view.
- New `printBill(Request, Student)` method: resolves term (from `?term_id=` query param), loads fee items via `FeeStatusService`, computes arrears (outstanding per-term fees from previous terms of same academic year), loads school profile + logo base64, streams PDF via `term-bill-pdf.blade.php`.

**Route**: `GET /fees/bill/{student}` → `FeeController::printBill` — gated by `fees.view` check inside the controller. Added as a literal path before the `{feeStructure}` wildcard routes.

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/fees/term-bill-pdf.blade.php`) — new file:
- Two copies per A4 page (each copy constrained to 135mm height) with a dashed cut line + "✂ cut here" label between.
- Header: school logo (base64, 12mm) + school name + "TERM FEE BILL" title + "School Copy" / "Parent Copy" label on right.
- Student info strip: Student Name | Admission No | Class + Section | Term.
- Fee items table: Fee Item | Type (Term/Annual badge) | Amount | Paid | Balance | Status badge. "Annual" fees show a purple `bg-accent-muted` badge; term fees show a blue badge.
- Arrears row (red, italic) shown only when `$arrearsTotal > 0`.
- Totals row: aggregate Amount | Paid | Grand Balance (outstanding + arrears); Grand Balance shown red when > 0.
- Footer: school address · phone + "computer-generated" note.
- DejaVu Sans font, inline styles only (no Tailwind — dompdf).

**View** (`resources/views/tenant/fees/index.blade.php`) — fee structure tab and collection tab updated:
- "Print Bill" button added in the selected student info bar — links to `/fees/bill/{student->id}?term_id={currentTerm->id}` (opens in new tab); only shown when a student is selected, gated by `@can('fees.view')`.
- Fee structure table: "Term" column header renamed to "Period"; annual fee rows show an "Annual" badge + academic year name instead of term name.
- `openEdit()` now passes `billing_cycle` and `academic_year_id` into the Alpine form.
- Both Add and Edit forms: added "Billing Cycle" toggle (Per Term / Annual) above the Academic Year/Term row. Academic Term dropdown is hidden (`x-show`) when Annual is selected. `academic_year_id` is passed as a hidden field.
- Alpine `feeStructureTab()` function: added `currentYearId` fourth parameter; added `billing_cycle` and `academic_year_id` to `form`; updated `init()` old() restoration; `openAdd()` resets `billing_cycle='term'` and sets `academic_year_id=currentYearId`; `openEdit()` falls back to `currentYearId` if `academic_year_id` missing.

**Action required**: Run `php artisan tenants:migrate` to apply `2026_06_16_000006_add_billing_cycle_to_fee_structures.php`.

### 2026-06-19 — Feature 21 Impersonation (session-based, audit-logged, 1-hour expiry)

**Migration** (`database/migrations/2026_06_19_000001_create_impersonation_logs_table.php`): Central DB table `impersonation_logs` — `id` (uuid PK), `super_admin_id` (FK → super_admins cascade), `tenant_id` (FK → tenants cascade), `impersonated_user_id` (uuid — the tenant `users.id`), `started_at`, `ended_at` (nullable). No standard timestamps (uses `started_at`/`ended_at` as the audit trail). `$connection = 'central'` on the migration class.

**Model** (`app/Models/Central/ImpersonationLog.php`): Central connection, `HasUuids`, `$timestamps = false`, fillable: `super_admin_id`, `tenant_id`, `impersonated_user_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`. BelongsTo relationships to `SuperAdmin` and `Tenant`.

**ImpersonationController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Central/ImpersonationController.php`): `start(Tenant $tenant)` — (1) finds school_admin user via `$tenant->run()`, (2) creates `ImpersonationLog` row in the central DB with `started_at = now()`, (3) writes a 90-second cache token containing `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `log_id`, (4) redirects to `{tenant_domain}/impersonate/{token}`. The 90-second token bridges the central → tenant subdomain session gap (separate cookies per domain). Old `impersonate()` method removed from `SuperAdminController`.

**ImpersonateController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/ImpersonateController.php`): **Rewritten** from the previous cache-token-only approach.
- `handle(string $token)`: validates cache token (single-use via `Cache::pull`), stores impersonation state in the tenant session: `impersonating`, `impersonating_tenant_id`, `impersonating_user_id`, `impersonating_log_id`, `impersonating_started_at` (Unix timestamp). Redirects to `/dashboard`. Does NOT call `Auth::login()` — authentication is handled per-request by `ResumeImpersonation` middleware.
- `exit()`: reads `impersonating_log_id` from session, updates `ImpersonationLog::on('central')->find($logId)->update(['ended_at' => now()])`, then `session()->forget(...)` the impersonation keys (does NOT call `Auth::logout()` or `session()->invalidate()`). Redirects to `config('app.url') . '/super-admin'`.

**ResumeImpersonation middleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/ResumeImpersonation.php`): Runs on every tenant request (registered in the top-level tenant domain route group, after `InitializeTenancyByDomain`).
- Skips if `session('impersonating')` is falsy or `session('impersonating_tenant_id') !== tenant('id')`.
- Enforces 1-hour limit: if `(time() - session('impersonating_started_at')) > 3600`, calls `expireSession()` (marks `ended_at` on log, clears session keys) and redirects to `/login` with expiry error.
- On valid session: calls `Auth::onceUsingId(session('impersonating_user_id'))` — logs in for this request only, never written to session. The tenant `web` guard session keys are never set, so the super_admin guard session on `schoolflow.com` (separate domain cookie) is completely untouched.
- Registered as `resume_impersonation` alias in `Kernel.php`.

**Routes**: `web.php` — `/super-admin/tenants/{tenant}/impersonate` now routes to `ImpersonationController::start` (was `SuperAdminController::impersonate`). `tenant.php` — `ResumeImpersonation::class` added to the top-level domain middleware array (between `RemoveTenantDomainParam` and the route closure).

**Super Admin dashboard** (`central/super-admin/dashboard.blade.php`): "Login to School" button renamed to "Impersonate".

**Tenant layout banner** (`layouts/tenant.blade.php`): Updated to `"You are viewing as {school name} (Super Admin support session) — any changes are real and attributed to the school admin account."` with an "Exit Impersonation" button. Banner uses `border-b-2` (heavier border) for better visual weight. No close/dismiss control — it is non-dismissible by design.

**Invariants enforced:**
- Super_admin guard is never touched during impersonation — `Auth::onceUsingId()` only affects the `web` guard for the duration of one request, never the session
- Every start/stop is logged to `impersonation_logs` in the central DB
- Sessions auto-expire after 1 hour; expiry is caught in the middleware and the log row is closed
- The impersonation banner is non-dismissible (no dismiss button, no Alpine x-show)
- Cache token TTL is 90 seconds (was 60) to survive slow redirects

**Action required**: Run `php artisan migrate` on the central DB to create the `impersonation_logs` table.

## Notes

- Tailwind `tailwind.config.js` still exists in the project root but is ignored by Tailwind v4 (no `@config` import in app.css). Can be deleted once confirmed no other tooling reads it.
- The old `layouts/app.blade.php` and `layouts/guest.blade.php` (Breeze defaults) are still present — they will be replaced or removed in Phase 1.4 (Auth & Roles).
- The `routes/auth.php` (Breeze) is still included; auth routes point to the default Breeze views which will be updated in Phase 1.4.
- A test `demo` tenant exists in the `schoolflow` DB with domain `demo.schoolflow.test` and DB `tenantdemo`. Remove before production or in Phase 03 seeder.
